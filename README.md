### Proposal

I am planning to make a smart plug to learn about the complete IoT ecosystem. I believe that there are 3 crucial components to an IoT system :  
  - Hardware - The hardware consist of the paricle mcroprocessor and sensors like current breakout sensor, neopixel etc. 
  - Software - code and the interface to set up the device and make it usable for users with distinct demands
  - Integration with exsting IoT infrastructure - The IoT device should have a meaningful connectivity to the existing IoT ecosystem like Siri, Amazon Alexa and Google Home.

### Sprints

* [Sprint 1: MVP](sprint-1/README.md)
This sprint focussed on making the bare bones of the hardware, and integrating to the existing IoT infrastructure i.e. Siri. 
* [Sprint 2: Adding Intelligence](sprint-2/README.md)
This sprint focussed on giving the smart plug more functionality by adding a current breakout sensor and calibrating the sensor, adding the neopixel to give a viisual feedback to the users. 
* [Sprint 3: Connectivity](sprint-3/README.md)
This sprint focussed on making a final soldered circuit and uploading data to Microsoft azure for data visualization.
* [Final Sprint](final-sprint/README.md)
